        <h1>My favorite movie in my life is Star Wars</h1>
        <img src="star-wars-wallpaper-4.jpg" width="450px">
        <p> It has been my favorite movie my whole life. I don't know how it all started, but it happened when I was little. I use to own a VHS tape of Starwars: The Phantom Menace. I have Lego Star Wars sets that I got when i was little as well. I owned the second Star Wars movie; Star Wars: Attack of the clones. I also use to wake up at six in the morning on Saturday to watch the series; Star Wars: The Clone Wars. When I heard LucasFilm was making the 7th Star Wars movie; Star Wars The Force Awakens, I was very happy to see the Star Wars Saga continue. Now, I'm making a stormtrooper costume from the Force Awakens and I'm making it out of cardboard. There's going to be lots of details and instead of having a mask, It's going to come with a helmet. I wish I could where it to school one day, either the Friday of when The next Star Wars movie comes out or on the day of Halloween. i have loved Star Wars my whole life and will continue to.</p>
